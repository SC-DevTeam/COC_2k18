A small effort to keep up the RE around SC. Merry Christmas!

This is an attempt to reverse engineer clash of clans which is now protected by a commercial llvm compiler (probably arxan)
The unique way I did found to understand the program flow is by emulation, mostly for the encryption which is obfuscated.
This is a wip but with a lot of patience and work Im going to solve this somehow
